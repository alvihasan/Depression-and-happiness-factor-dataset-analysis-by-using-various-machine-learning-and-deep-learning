# Depression-and-happiness-factor-dataset-analysis-by-using-various-machine-learning-and-deep-learning
In this project a depression & happiness factor dataset has been built and analysed by machine & deep ;earning algorithm 
# Dataset building
For this project a datset has been built. The dataset has been built by using 21 questionnaire using google form. I have regulary updated this dataset by answering this question. The question is related to academic, personal, and social life and how those incident has been related to happiness and depression. Dataset can be found at dataset folder
# Analysis of the dataset
various machine learning and deep learning algorithm has been used for analysing this dataset which are
1. Apriori algorithm
2. Desiscion tree algorithm
3. K means clustering
4. Linear regression algorithm
5. Artificial neural network
